LSM trees can handle higher write workloads and 
B-trees are good for high read workload. 





replication of data.
Single master slave replication : All writes go to one node, called master. 
    The changes in master node are replicated to other nodes, called slaves. Read requests can go to either master or slave.
    
Many master replication: Instead of writes going to one master, 
      they can go to many masters. Masters can then replicate changes made to their data stores to other slaves nodes. 
      Read requests can go to either master or slave.

No master replication: There are no master and slaves in this setup. 
      Writes and reads can be sent to any node.

Note: An important detail worth mentioning is the manner in which replication happens. It can either be synchronous or asynchronous.
